**Simon Game** is an interactive memory game where players must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. The game helps to improve memory and reaction time by testing players' ability to follow a pattern.

This project was part of my **JavaScript learning journey** where I focused on **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **JavaScript array logic**.

### 🖥️ **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML** for the structure
- **CSS** for styling and animations
- **JavaScript** for game logic and interactivity

---

### 🎮 **How to Play:**
1. Press any key to start the game.
2. The game will flash a random sequence of colored buttons.
3. Your task is to click the colored buttons in the exact sequence.
4. As you successfully complete levels, the sequence becomes longer and more complex.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends and shows your score.
